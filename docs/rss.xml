&#13;
Jianxin here! I'm a second-year PhD student at ECNU knee-deep in the AI4S pool, specifically focusing on protein design and engineering. Imagine trying to craft the perfect protein from scratch, that’s basically my daily life. And yes, there’s a lot of trial and (often spectacular) error involved! But I also have a soft spot for NLP—because, you know, why not add another layer of complexity to my life? &#13;
&#13;
When I’m not staring at code or lab equipment, I’m most likely yelling at the TV in support of Liverpool (YNWA!) or getting thoroughly schooled in CS2. Let’s just say I’m not winning any esports trophies anytime soon – my reflexes are not what they used to be… I'm the definition of too old and numbooo at this point! &#13;
&#13;
I’ll be sharing my experiences, both successful (rare) and less successful (frequent), so buckle up, it's gonna be a ride!。</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://Jianxinnn.github.io/post/Hello%20World.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 03:05:58 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
